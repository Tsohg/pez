#	This is a comment in pez.

#	Scope is delimited by tabs. In other words, the body of an if statement is the number of tabs + 1. The body will end when it has the same number of tabs as the if statement line.

#	If statements -> if condition

if x == y
	x + 1

#	If statements may also have an else statement. The else must share a scope with it's paired if statement.

if x == y
	x + 1
else
	x + 2

#	lpw keyword is the pez while loop -> lpw condition

lpw x == y
	x + 1

#	lpf keyword is the pez for loop -> lpf x :: y 
#	Where X and Y are both integers. (Variables for X and Y are not yet implemented as of 4/9/2020).
#	This loop is 1 based in pez. (Becomes zero based during C translation). 

lpf 1 :: 10
	x + 1

#	Variable definitions -> x = y
#	Where y is an integer or a variable. (Other types yet to be implemented).

x = 10

#	Function definitions -> func funcName a b c d e f g
#	Where:
#		Keyword: func
#		Function Name: funcName
#		Parameters: a b c d e f g
#	Below is a void function with no parameters. (Currently not implemented as of 4/9/2020)
