#	This is a comment in pez.

#	Scope is delimited by tabs. In other words, the body of an if statement is the number of tabs + 1. The body will end when it has the same number of tabs as the if statement line.

#	If statements -> if condition

if x == y
	x + 1
									
#	lpw keyword is the pez while loop -> lpw condition

lpw x == y
	x + 1

#	lpf keyword is the pez for loop -> lpf x :: y 
#	Where X and Y are both integers. Variables are not yet implemented.
#	This loop is 1 based in pez. (Becomes zero based during C translation). 

lpf 1 :: 10
	x + 1

#	Variable definitions -> x = y
#	Where y is an integer or a variable. (Other types yet to be implemented).

x = 10

if x == z
	z + 1
else
	z + 2
#else #this should not compile correctly in pez as it would not compile correctly in other languages. so that's on the todo list for later.
	#z + 3
